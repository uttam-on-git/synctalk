This repository contains the frontend client for **SyncTalk**, a full-stack, real-time chat application. This React application provides the user interface for signing up, logging in, creating and joining chat rooms, and sending messages instantly.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Modern UI:** Built with React, TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS for a beautiful and responsive user experience.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Connects to the backend via WebSockets (Socket.IO) to send and receive messages instantly without page reloads.
- **Multi-Room Interface:** Features a dynamic sidebar to list and select chat rooms, and a main panel to display the message history and compose new messages.
- **Secure Authentication Flow:** Handles user registration and login, securely storing JWTs in local storage to manage user sessions.
- **Modular & Scalable:** Architected with a focus on reusable UI components, custom hooks (`useAuth`, `useRooms`, `useMessages`), and a global `AuthContext` for clean state management.
